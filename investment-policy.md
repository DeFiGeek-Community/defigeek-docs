# DFGC Investment Management Standard

### **Investment Objective**

Our overarching goal is to contribute to growth of the fund by securing investment returns with managed risk and a medium- to long-term focus.

### **Investment Guideline**

Invests in multiple yield farming strategies to achieve additional returns while maintaining the fund's current exposures to cryptocurrencies. In addition, the fund will invest in DFGC-led projects as an early stage investor (seed round or subsequent series) to achieve adding value to our ecosystem.

### **Investment Method**

In principle, the investment universe is limited to yield farming (including hedging transactions) strategies and DFGC-led projects (seed round or subsequent series). The fund will not open and hold short-term long/short crypto positions to aim capital gains.

### **Investment Management**

Fund managers shall present the following 6 criteria on investment proposals. Each investment proposal needs to be approved by community votes. Investment proposals that exceed the investment/transfer threshold will be subject to a snapshot vote.

1. Outline of the investment
2. Proposed investment amount
3. Profitability level
   1. Target return
   2. Estimated investment tenor
   3. Exit currency
4. Security report
5. Front-end operating procedures
6. Exit criteria

* Each transaction will be executed to minimize the total transaction costs, taking the best way of execution & deferral of taxable events into consideration.
* Fund managers shall analyze a series of post investment actions and reflect the results in portfolio management to continuously improve our operations.
* Fund managers shall utilize secured borrowings for investment. The max borrowing level is set at Health Rate of 2 (utilization ratio of 50%) and additional borrowing proposals at or above the level is prohibited.
* The borrowing rate will be monitored continuously and fund managers shall propose partial repayment of borrowings or adding collateral at Health Rate of 1.5 (utilization ratio of 67%). However, in light of the urgency, it will be exempted from Snapshot Voting criterion for investment transfer threshold, and a Reaction Voting will be taken.
* When the Health Rate reaches 1.25 (utilization ratio of 80%), the emergency committee shall execute exit of investments & debt repayment immediately regardless of whether or not a Reaction Voting has taken as described in the previous section. The first order of exit will be stablecoin LP/yield farming strategy.
