# DFGC Community Overview

## Community Overview

DeFiGeek Community (DFGC) is a decentralized autonomous organization from Japan. We aim to be the most active and valuable one in Japanese-speaking communities, which focuses on the development of Web3 middleware and tools.

Our first Dapp is ‘Yamato Protocol’. It is a crypto-backed stablecoin which is pegged to Japanese Yen. Our second Dapp is ‘Yorozu’ .It is a P2Pool Lending Dapp. Besides the Dapps mentioned above, We also plan to develop a NFT platform and web3 tools to extend the token utility.

To become a flat and sustainable organization, we have been making efforts to increase the fluidity within the allocation of roles to avoid authority. We welcome all members to demonstrate initiative and leadership. In order to achieve our goals, we are not only working on Dapp development, but also on establishing Code of Conduct and various Guidelines to define discipline, values and objectives.

Please note that we are not a community for short-term trading and speculation and it is not encouraged to have such price discussion in the community.

## Working Group

Working Groups have been established to oblige running the continuity for specific missions. Currently there is no set process for joining working groups. Those who have continuously performed related tasks or those who have been hired on ad-hoc basis have participated in the working groups.

  * Information about Dapps development is treated confidential during initial phases until official launch.
  * Applicants for the development department will be judged by existing core members if they are to be trustworthy from multiple perspectives. Inevitably, only a small number of prominent talents will be selected.
  * Developers are not necessarily required to be familiar with crypto from day 1. In fact, some members have deepened their understanding of crypto protocols while developing the front-end.
