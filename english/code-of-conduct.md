# Code of Conduct

:information\_source:This policy applies to all community activities not limited to product development, marketing, financing, voting, proposals, or communications on Discord or elsewhere.

### **Rationale**

Our goal is to continue to release DeFi Dapps and middleware that contribute to Web3 and to grow DAO as a flat and sustainable organization. Proactive involvement by each community member in various initiatives are key to success.

Not limited to core members such as the experts, strategists, or community leaders but also all community members should treat each other with respect and value the unique contribution of others.

### **What is Encouraged & Discouraged**

#### **What is encouraged**

* Active communication among independent members.
* Proactive suggestions and executions that contribute to development of the community.
* Constructive debates and discussion including disagreements or doubts.
* Propose your ideas & opinions to the community to build community consensus.
* Participate in community consensus building mechanisms by taking part in voting.

#### **What is discouraged**

* Expecting others to be your subordinate or superior.
* e.g., acting in a coercive manner and asking others why they are not doing what is necessary
* Subjective arguments without supporting external data.
* Act as if one is representing the community without prior consent from the community.

### **Unacceptable behaviors**

The followings are unacceptable and violations of the Code of Conduct.

* Harassment - Unwelcome advances (sexual or romantic), offensive or derogatory comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, body size, race and religion.
* Intimidation - Threatening someone  verbally or in writing.
* Malice - direct abuse - intentionally trying to make others feel bad, swearing, singling out others for disrespect or exclusion. For example, commenting on a person is unworthy in a public channel.
* Malignancy - Repeatedly engaging in behavior that is discouraged, persistently ignoring arbitration or warnings by others, or otherwise being found to be malicious by community members.

### **Enforcement**

Any unacceptable behavior discovered or reported will be evaluated by community moderators. If the behavior is deemed inappropriate and against the Code of Conduct, the account will be permanently banned.&#x20;

The moderator must clearly state the nature of the enforcement and reason for the decision in a public channel.

### **Resignation**

It is inevitable that community members will come and go. However please remind that there should be someone who takes over from the vacuum that would have been left by the individual who would have left.&#x20;

If you are a role holder or are working on specific tasks, notify resignation to community members first then take a proper handover process ahead of your resignation date in order for someone else to carry over your former duties and responsibilities.

### **Reporting**

If you suffer or find any violations to the Code of Conduct, please DM (direct message) to community moderators. The anonymity of reporters will be secured and treated in a confidential manner.
