# Voting System

Community members have been exercised voting rights to make decisions as needed.&#x20;

The governance system consists of two ways of voting.

* Reaction Voting
  * Using the reaction button on Discord
* Forum Voting
  * [https://gov.defigeek.xyz/](https://gov.defigeek.xyz/)
* Snapshot Voting
  * Using TXJP tokens
  * [https://vote.defigeek.xyz/](https://vote.defigeek.xyz/)

The supremacy order of voting is 1st Snapshot Voting, 2nd Forum Voting and 3rd Reaction Voting. Snapshot vote is the supreme voting for making resolutions on important matters. Any consensus built at Reaction or Forum Voting can be reassessed in Snapshot Voting if needed.

The Forum Voting and Reaction Voting should be used to facilitate day-to-day operations. (i.e. presounding multiple proposals or used as a questionnaire). Both voting methods can be used to reach community consensus.

## **Rules**

### **1. Operations that require approval (majority and quorum) on Snapshot Voting**&#x20;

**Payment**&#x20;

* Individual cases: 200,000 yen equivalent or more&#x20;
* Joint cases: 1,000,000 yen equivalent or more (i.e. lump-sum approval of monthly compensation)&#x20;

**Investment Transfer**&#x20;

* 10,000,000 yen equivalent or more

### **2. Exceptions**

The emergency committee execution (exit of investment & debt repayment) led by the strategist role holders is exempted from Rules section #1 in accordance with the "Investment Management Standard. Community voting may be skipped.

## **Voting Guidelines**

Voting is a formal means of building community consensus.&#x20;

The following decisions are critical to the community and must be voted and approved to reach consensus.&#x20;

* Governance matters, such as the addition, modification, or deletion to community rules&#x20;
* Financial matters, including compensation.&#x20;
* Other matters that the members believe have significant impacts on the community.

In addition to the above, members may use voting for other purposes, such as sounding with the community, i.e. to hold soundings on multiple proposals.

The creator of the vote shall consider whether the purpose and background is well communicated to the community and whether the content serves the interests of the community. If there is any doubt about the content of the vote, consult with the community members beforehand.

## **Voting Methods**

### **Reaction Voting**

Reaction Voting is a voting method using the reaction function on Discord.&#x20;

It is a chat message and easy to conduct compared with other voting methods.&#x20;

In order to ensure the fairness and transparency of voting, the following rules are defined.

Rules:

* Voting must be conducted on a defined channel.
* If a discussion occurs on multiple channels, it should be compiled and URL link should be posted to direct community members to the voting place. Voting outline should be re-posted at the voting place.
  * Post URL to "#Voting Place" to direct community members from the original channel where discussion has started.
* The minimum tenor for voting will be 3 days (72 hours). Indefinite or longer tenor may be selected as necessary in consideration of the content.
* Be sure to clearly indicate the due date & time for voting.
  * Since it is not possible to restrict people voting after the due, the result must be posted at the due by modifying original message (i.e. add comment as "Result: Yes #, No #").
* At least three choices must be provided at voting: "〇," "X," and "Neither”. Other choices are optional.
* Multiple symbols :one: :two: :three: etc. must be used for  Multiple-choice voting.
* Instruction to multiple or single vote should be given as needed. However, single-vote instructions do not prevent multiple voting.
* Both contents and choices of voting can be altered due to functionality of Discord by modifying the original message. (Please use the best judgment in accordance with your moral standard.)
* In principle, a majority is considered as a decision.
* In case of disagreement to the result, it is preferred to move to Snapshot Voting. (Snapshot Voting supersedes Reaction Voting)

### **Forum Voting**

Forum Voting is a voting feature in the comments section of a forum.

Compared to Discord, Forum Voting is better suited for discussion if the topic is clear.

If the topic is clear, you can kick off a discussion in the forum. If the topic is unclear, it is recommended to start the discussion on Discord first, work out the details of the proposal, and then move to the forum.

In principle, the same rules apply as for Reaction Voting. It is recommended to announce on Discord when the voting starts at forum.

### **Snapshot Voting**

Snapshot Voting is the supreme decision making for the community.&#x20;

By its nature, the motion to set up a Snapshot Voting must be done with extra care. Specifically, the following considerations are assumed beforehand**.**

* Discussion on discord server in advance
* Presounding by using Reaction Voting or Forum Voting
