# SNS Operational Guidlines

We use various social media accounts as official channels for broadcasting news and information. This is a core part of our public relations efforts to increase engagement.

* Target to gain greater public interest in DFGC and increase our community members.
* Announce project information and articles published in timely manner.
* For greater engagement, community members are encouraged to "like" our posts and retweets, and mentioning our accounts.

## Accounts

&#x20;Public Relations SNS accounts will operate as follows.

### DFGC Main account

* https://twitter.com/defigeekjapan
* Tweet about general DFGC information.
* Retweet the tweets from DFGC project accounts.
* Tweet about DFGC projects that do not have a project account.\


### &#x20;Project account

* DFGC runs multiple projects and does not represent one community per project. Each project account does not represent a community, but rather its own initiative.

### &#x20;Yamato Protocol account

* https://twitter.com/yamatoprotocol\


### Yashiro Project account

* Pending account opening.

### Global account

* https://twitter.com/DeFiGeekJapanEN
* Establish global presence and facilitate collaboration with overseas projects.

## SNS Operational Guidlines

Basic guidelines for posting.

### 1. Being courteous

* Use polite language and correct terminology. (e.g., DeFi, not Defi)
* Do not compare with others (other companies or other projects) and communicate only about ourselves.
* Do not use a style of communication that demonstrates the personality of the Admin in order to build a fan base.
* Do not mention other accounts or react to the mentions you receive from other accounts.
* Do not react to other tweets (retweet, like, or mention) including news articles. This is to avoid being perceived as an endorsement by DFGC. Exceptions stated in Section 2.
* Follow only DFGC Main account and DFGC project accounts.\


### 2. Official collaborations may be explicitly mentioned.

* Collaboration or partnership projects account (@their\_account) will be clearly mentioned in our post and may follow the account to indicate this. Admin will carefully consider whether this is appropriate, or seek community input.

### Tips

* Make sure hashtags are set properly
* Main accounts: #DFGC,$TXJP,$CJPY
* Yamato: #Yamato,$YMT,$CJPY

Q: Are Emoji and casual expression acceptable to some extent?&#x20;

A. Yes, as long as it is in preceived as appropriate in social norm and not offensive to others.
